# Junction-X-Seoul-2020

## - Our application, "zuk box,"  is a "music map SNS service" that shares the songs a user is listening to with users within a 5-km radius around them, by viewing a map.

## - description 
The idea behind our project is to create an alternate way of sharing and connecting interests through music. These connections are especially powerful during a time of isolation like the period the world is currently going through.
